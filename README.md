HELLO!

Thanks for checking out and taking the time to test this project.

To run the project please type the following command lines:

1) TO INSTALL THE APPLICATION
npm install

2) TO TEST THE APPLICATION
npm start /pathtofiletotest.txt
Please be aware that if you want to test directly on the Lengaburu family, the family is already build by using the 
./ResultsAndInputFiles/Input/OriginalLengaburuFamily.txt document.
If you wish to use another document you can use the following config key
 export let ORIGINAL_FAMILY_TREE_FILE = './ResultsAndInputFiles/Input/OriginalLengaburuFamily.txt';
 in ./src/Constants/Constants.ts

3) TO RUN THE UNIT TESTS
npm test

4) DOCUMENTATION:
I've added a documentation file explaining the architecture and the code structure decision in
./ShippitExplanationDocument.docx
